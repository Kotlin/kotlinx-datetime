/**
 * A moment in time.
 *
 * A point in time must be uniquely identified so that it is independent of a time zone.
 * For example, `1970-01-01, 00:00:00` does not represent a moment in time since this would happen at different times
 * in different time zones: someone in Tokyo would think it is already `1970-01-01` several hours earlier than someone in
 * Berlin would. To represent such entities, use [LocalDateTime].
 * In contrast, "the moment the clocks in London first showed 00:00 on Jan 1, 2000" is a specific moment
 * in time, as is "1970-01-01, 00:00:00 UTC+0", so it can be represented as an [Instant].
 *
 * `Instant` uses the UTC-SLS (smeared leap second) time scale. This time scale doesn't contain instants
 * corresponding to leap seconds, but instead "smears" positive and negative leap seconds among the last 1000 seconds
 * of the day when a leap second happens.
 *
 * ### Obtaining the current moment
 *
 * The [Clock] interface is the primary way to obtain the current moment:
 *
 * ```
 * val clock: Clock = Clock.System
 * val instant = clock.now()
 * ```
 *
 * The [Clock.System] implementation uses the platform-specific system clock to obtain the current moment.
 * Note that this clock is not guaranteed to be monotonic, and it may be adjusted by the user or the system at any time,
 * so it should not be used for measuring time intervals.
 * For that, consider using [TimeSource.Monotonic] and [TimeMark] instead of [Clock.System] and [Instant].
 *
 * ### Obtaining human-readable representations
 *
 * #### Date and time
 *
 * [Instant] is essentially the number of seconds and nanoseconds since a designated moment in time,
 * stored as something like `1709898983.123456789`.
 * [Instant] does not contain information about the day or time, as this depends on the time zone.
 * To work with this information for a specific time zone, obtain a [LocalDateTime] using [Instant.toLocalDateTime]:
 *
 * ```
 * val instant = Instant.fromEpochSeconds(1709898983, 123456789)
 * instant.toLocalDateTime(TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin")) // 2024-03-08T12:56:23.123456789
 * instant.toLocalDateTime(TimeZone.UTC) // 2024-03-08T11:56:23.123456789
 * ```
 *
 * For values very far in the past or the future, this conversion may fail.
 * The specific range of values that can be converted to [LocalDateTime] is platform-specific, but at least
 * [DISTANT_PAST], [DISTANT_FUTURE], and all values between them can be converted to [LocalDateTime].
 *
 * #### Date or time separately
 *
 * To obtain a [LocalDate] or [LocalTime], first, obtain a [LocalDateTime], and then use its [LocalDateTime.date]
 * and [LocalDateTime.time] properties:
 *
 * ```
 * val instant = Instant.fromEpochSeconds(1709898983, 123456789)
 * instant.toLocalDateTime(TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin")).date // 2024-03-08
 * ```
 *
 * ### Arithmetic operations
 *
 * #### Elapsed-time-based
 *
 * The [plus] and [minus] operators can be used to add [Duration]s to and subtract them from an [Instant]:
 *
 * ```
 * Clock.System.now() + 5.seconds // 5 seconds from now
 * ```
 *
 * Durations can also be represented as multiples of some [time-based date-time unit][DateTimeUnit.TimeBased]:
 *
 * ```
 * Clock.System.now().plus(4, DateTimeUnit.HOUR) // 4 hours from now
 * ```
 *
 * Also, there is a [minus] operator that returns the [Duration] representing the difference between two instants:
 *
 * ```
 * val start = Clock.System.now()
 * val concertStart = LocalDateTime(2023, 1, 1, 20, 0, 0).toInstant(TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin"))
 * val timeUntilConcert = concertStart - start
 * ```
 *
 * #### Calendar-based
 *
 * Since [Instant] represents a point in time, it is always well-defined what the result of arithmetic operations on it
 * is, including the cases when a calendar is used.
 * This is not the case for [LocalDateTime], where the result of arithmetic operations depends on the time zone.
 * See the [LocalDateTime] documentation for more details.
 *
 * Adding and subtracting calendar-based units can be done using the [plus] and [minus] operators,
 * requiring a [TimeZone]:
 *
 * ```
 * // One day from now in Berlin
 * Clock.System.now().plus(1, DateTimeUnit.DAY, TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin"))
 *
 * // A day and two hours short from two months later in Berlin
 * Clock.System.now().plus(DateTimePeriod(months = 2, days = -1, hours = -2), TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin"))
 * ```
 *
 * The difference between [Instant] values in terms of calendar-based units can be obtained using the [periodUntil]
 * method:
 *
 * ```
 * val start = Clock.System.now()
 * val concertStart = LocalDateTime(2023, 1, 1, 20, 0, 0).toInstant(TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin"))
 * val timeUntilConcert = start.periodUntil(concertStart, TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin"))
 * // Two months, three days, four hours, and five minutes until the concert
 * ```
 *
 * or [Instant.until] method, as well as [Instant.daysUntil], [Instant.monthsUntil],
 * and [Instant.yearsUntil] extension functions:
 *
 * ```
 * val start = Clock.System.now()
 * val concertStart = LocalDateTime(2023, 1, 1, 20, 0, 0).toInstant(TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin"))
 * val timeUntilConcert = start.until(concertStart, DateTimeUnit.DAY, TimeZone.of("Europe/Berlin"))
 * // 63 days until the concert, rounded down
 * ```
 *
 * ### Platform specifics
 *
 * On the JVM, there are `Instant.toJavaInstant()` and `java.time.Instant.toKotlinInstant()`
 * extension functions to convert between `kotlinx.datetime` and `java.time` objects used for the same purpose.
 * Similarly, on the Darwin platforms, there are `Instant.toNSDate()` and `NSDate.toKotlinInstant()`
 * extension functions.
 *
 * ### Construction, serialization, and deserialization
 *
 * [fromEpochSeconds] can be used to construct an instant from the number of seconds since
 * `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z` (the Unix epoch).
 * [epochSeconds] and [nanosecondsOfSecond] can be used to obtain the number of seconds and nanoseconds since the epoch.
 *
 * ```
 * val instant = Instant.fromEpochSeconds(1709898983, 123456789)
 * instant.epochSeconds // 1709898983
 * instant.nanosecondsOfSecond // 123456789
 * ```
 *
 * [fromEpochMilliseconds] allows constructing an instant from the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
 * [toEpochMilliseconds] can be used to obtain the number of milliseconds since the epoch.
 * Note that [Instant] supports nanosecond precision, so converting to milliseconds is a lossy operation.
 *
 * ```
 * val instant1 = Instant.fromEpochSeconds(1709898983, 123456789)
 * instant1.nanosecondsOfSecond // 123456789
 * val milliseconds = instant1.toEpochMilliseconds() // 1709898983123
 * val instant2 = Instant.fromEpochMilliseconds(milliseconds)
 * instant2.nanosecondsOfSecond // 123000000
 * ```
 *
 * [parse] and [toString] methods can be used to obtain an [Instant] from and convert it to a string in the
 * ISO 8601 extended format.
 *
 * ```
 * val instant = Instant.parse("2023-01-02T22:35:01+01:00")
 * instant.toString() // 2023-01-02T21:35:01Z
 * ```
 *
 * During parsing, the UTC offset is not returned separately.
 * If the UTC offset is important, use [DateTimeComponents] with [DateTimeComponents.Formats.ISO_DATE_TIME_OFFSET] to
 * parse the string instead.
 *
 * [Instant.parse] and [Instant.format] also accept custom formats:
 *
 * ```
 * val customFormat = DateTimeComponents.Format {
 *   date(LocalDate.Formats.ISO)
 *   char(' ')
 *   time(LocalTime.Formats.ISO)
 *   char(' ')
 *   offset(UtcOffset.Formats.ISO)
 * }
 * val instant = Instant.parse("2023-01-02 22:35:01.14 +01:00", customFormat)
 * instant.format(customFormat, offset = UtcOffset(hours = 2)) // 2023-01-02 23:35:01.14 +02:00
 * ```
 *
 * Additionally, there are several `kotlinx-serialization` serializers for [Instant]:
 * - [InstantIso8601Serializer] for the ISO 8601 extended format.
 * - [InstantComponentSerializer] for an object with components.
 *
 * @see LocalDateTime for a user-visible representation of moments in time in an unspecified time zone.
