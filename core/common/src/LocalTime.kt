/**
 * The time part of [LocalDateTime].
 *
 * This class represents time-of-day without referencing a specific date.
 * To reconstruct a full [LocalDateTime], representing civil date and time, [LocalTime] needs to be
 * combined with [LocalDate] via [LocalDate.atTime] or [LocalTime.atDate].
 *
 * Also, [LocalTime] does not reference a particular time zone.
 * Therefore, even on the same date, [LocalTime] denotes different moments of time.
 * For example, `18:43` happens at different moments in Berlin and in Tokyo.
 * It may not even exist or be ambiguous on days when clocks are adjusted.
 *
 * The arithmetic on [LocalTime] values is not provided, since without accounting for the time zone
 * transitions it may give misleading results.
 *
 * ### Arithmetic operations
 *
 * Arithmetic operations on [LocalTime] are not provided because they are not well-defined without a date and
 * a time zone.
 * See [LocalDateTime] for an explanation of why not accounting for time zone transitions may lead to incorrect results.
 * To perform arithmetic operations on time values, first, obtain an [Instant].
 *
 * ```
 * val time = LocalTime(13, 30)
 * val date = Clock.System.todayAt(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())
 * val instant = time.atDate(date).toInstant(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault())
 * val instantThreeHoursLater = instant.plus(3.hours)
 * val timeThreeHoursLater = instantThreeHoursLater.toLocalDateTime(TimeZone.currentSystemDefault()).time
 * ```
 *
 * Since this pattern is extremely verbose and difficult to get right, it is recommended to work exclusively
 * with [Instant] and only obtain a [LocalTime] when displaying the time to the user.
 *
 * ### Platform specifics
 *
 * On the JVM,
 * there are `LocalTime.toJavaLocalTime()` and `java.time.LocalTime.toKotlinLocalTime()`
 * extension functions to convert between `kotlinx.datetime` and `java.time` objects used for the same purpose.
 *
 * ### Construction, serialization, and deserialization
 *
 * [LocalTime] can be constructed directly from its components using the constructor. See sample 1.
 *
 * [fromSecondOfDay], [fromMillisecondOfDay], and [fromNanosecondOfDay] can be used to obtain a [LocalTime] from the
 * number of seconds, milliseconds, or nanoseconds since the start of the day, assuming that the offset from the UTC
 * does not change during the day.
 * [toSecondOfDay], [toMillisecondOfDay], and [toNanosecondOfDay] are the inverse operations.
 * See sample 2.
 *
 * [parse] and [toString] methods can be used to obtain a [LocalTime] from and convert it to a string in the
 * ISO 8601 extended format. See sample 3.
 *
 * [parse] and [LocalTime.format] both support custom formats created with [Format] or defined in [Formats].
 * See sample 4.
 *
 * Additionally, there are several `kotlinx-serialization` serializers for [LocalTime]:
 * - The default serializer, delegating to [toString] and [parse].
 * - [LocalTimeIso8601Serializer] for the ISO 8601 extended format,
 * - [LocalTimeComponentSerializer] for an object with components.
 *
 * @sample kotlinx.datetime.test.samples.LocalTimeSamples.construction
 * @sample kotlinx.datetime.test.samples.LocalTimeSamples.representingAsNumbers
